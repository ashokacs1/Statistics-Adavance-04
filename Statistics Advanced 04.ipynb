    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The key difference between these tests lies in the assumptions about the population and the sample size:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T-Test:\n",
    "   - The t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "   - It is suitable for testing hypotheses about a population mean.\n",
    "   - The t-test uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the standard normal (z) distribution, making it more appropriate for small sample sizes.\n",
    "   - There are two common types of t-tests: the one-sample t-test and the two-sample t-test.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example Scenario: You want to test if a new drug has a statistically significant effect on reducing blood pressure in a small group of 20 patients. You don't know the population standard deviation, so you use a one-sample t-test to compare the sample mean to a known or hypothesized population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Z-Test:\n",
    "   - The z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "   - It is also used to test hypotheses about a population mean.\n",
    "   - The z-test uses the standard normal distribution, which is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example Scenario: You are studying the heights of adult males in a large city and have access to the population's standard deviation. You want to determine if the average height of males in your sample of 100 individuals is significantly different from the known population mean. In this case, you would use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on the sample size and whether you know the population standard deviation. If the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown, you should use a t-test. If the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known, a z-test is more appropriate."

    "One-Tailed Test and Two-Tailed Test are two different types of hypothesis tests in statistics that are used to determine the significance of an effect or difference. The key difference between them lies in how they define the critical region and what kind of alternative hypotheses they test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One-Tailed Test:\n",
    "   - A one-tailed test, also known as a directional test, is used when you have a specific direction in mind for your hypothesis. You are interested in whether a parameter is significantly greater than or less than a certain value.\n",
    "   - In a one-tailed test, the critical region is located in only one tail of the distribution (either the right tail or the left tail, depending on the direction specified in the alternative hypothesis).\n",
    "   - The null hypothesis (H0) represents the status quo, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) specifies a directional change.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: You want to test if a new weight loss program is more effective in helping individuals lose weight compared to the current program. Your null hypothesis (H0) could be that there is no difference or the new program is less effective, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) would state that the new program is more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two-Tailed Test:\n",
    "   - A two-tailed test, also known as a non-directional test, is used when you are interested in whether a parameter is significantly different from a certain value, but you don't have a specific direction in mind. You are looking for any significant difference, whether it's greater or less than the specified value.\n",
    "   - In a two-tailed test, the critical region is split between both tails of the distribution.\n",
    "   - The null hypothesis (H0) typically states that there is no significant difference, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) states that there is a significant difference, without specifying a particular direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: You want to test if the mean IQ of a group of students is different from the national average IQ of 100. In this case, the null hypothesis (H0) would be that there is no difference, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) would be that there is a difference, without specifying whether it's higher or lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a one-tailed test and a two-tailed test depends on your research question and whether you have a specific directional hypothesis in mind. A one-tailed test is appropriate when you are interested in a specific direction of change, while a two-tailed test is used when you are only interested in detecting any significant difference, regardless of the direction."

    "   - Type I error occurs when you incorrectly reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. In other words, you conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is none.\n",
    "   - The probability of making a Type I error is denoted as the significance level (alpha, α), and it is typically set by the researcher (e.g., 0.05 for a 5% significance level).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Type II Error (False Negative):\n",
    "   - Type II error occurs when you incorrectly fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. In other words, you conclude that there is no significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is one.\n",
    "   - The probability of making a Type II error is denoted as beta (β).\n",

    "   Example Scenario: In a quality control process, the null hypothesis (H0) is that a manufacturing process is producing products with a certain level of defects. If, in reality, the process is producing more defective products (H0 is false), but the statistical test fails to detect this and does not reject H0, it would be a Type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the concepts of Type I and Type II errors are crucial in hypothesis testing because they highlight the trade-off between the risks of making incorrect decisions. Researchers aim to balance the two types of errors based on their specific goals and the consequences of each error type in a given scenario. Adjusting the significance level (α) and sample size can impact the likelihood of Type I and Type II errors, with a trade-off between them: reducing the probability of one type of error generally increases the probability of the other."

    "Let's illustrate Bayes's theorem with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a doctor and you need to diagnose a rare disease, \"Disease X,\" in a patient. The disease affects only 1% of the population. You have two diagnostic tests available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test A has a sensitivity of 90%, which means it correctly identifies the disease in 90% of the cases where it's present but gives false positives in 10% of the cases where the disease is not present.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have a new patient who tests positive for both Test A and Test B. You want to determine the probability that the patient actually has Disease X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes's theorem, you can calculate this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(P(A)\\): Prior probability of having Disease X = 1% = 0.01\n",
    "- \\(P(B|A)\\): Probability of testing positive for Test B given having Disease X = Sensitivity of Test B = 80% = 0.80\n",
    "- \\(P(B|\\neg A)\\): Probability of testing positive for Test B given not having Disease X = False positive rate of Test B = 5% = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can apply Bayes's theorem:\n",

    "\\[P(\\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, calculate \\(P(B)\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[P(B) = (0.80 \\cdot 0.01) + (0.05 \\cdot 0.99) = 0.008 + 0.0495 = 0.0575\\]\n",

    "\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{0.80 \\cdot 0.01}{0.0575} ≈ 0.1391\\]\n",
